Trading Strategies
1.	Proprietary Trading: Proprietary trading desks use the firm’s capital to execute trades, aiming for direct market gains rather than client commissions. This strategy includes various approaches such as index arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, and volatility arbitrage. The use of AI in proprietary trading helps in analyzing trader behavior, predicting market trends, and automating risk management processes (Investopedia).

Algorithms can analyze market conditions and execute trades at optimal times, significantly reducing the risk and increasing the potential for profit.
3.	Diversified Product Offerings: Brokerage firms are expanding their product suites to include options, futures, mutual funds, ETFs, and structured products. This diversification helps firms to cater to a broader range of clients and reduce dependency on a single revenue stream (FinModelsLab).
